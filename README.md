# Mesh Editor
## Commands:
* **MeshEditor.exe Cube L = 10, origin = (float, float, float), filepath = "path\to\save\cube.stl**
  (L - the length of a cube side. Origin - the position of the cube in a scene where commas separate the
   coordinates with or without white spaces)
* **MeshEditor.exe Sphere R = 10.0, origin = (4.5,3.4,2.1), slices = 3, rings = 4, filename = "path\to\save\sphere.stl"** (R - the radius.
origin is the position of the sphere in the 3D. Slices - number of vertical segments (meridians). Rings - number of horizontal segments (parallels)).
* **MeshEditor.exe Split input = "path\to\load\obj.stl", origin = (0,0,0), direction = (0,1,1), output1 = "path\to\save\A.stl", output2 = "path\to\save\B.stl"** (Origin - the position of the normal vector start in the 3D scene. Direction - the position of the normal vector direction in the 3D scene.)
